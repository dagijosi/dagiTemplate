A simple CLI tool to generate React starter projects with various configurations including **Redux Toolkit**, **React Query**, **Zustand**, and **Redux Saga** — in just a few seconds! Choose between **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** for your project.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🚀 Quickly scaffold a new React project.
- 🔄 Choose between TypeScript and JavaScript.
- 📦 Multiple template options to fit your needs.
- ⚡ No global install needed — run directly with `npx`.
- 🛠 Automatically installs dependencies after generation.

---

## 📦 Installation

You don't need to install anything!

Just run it using **npx**:

```bash
npx react-dagis
```

Follow the prompts to select your language, template, and name your project.

---

## 🚀 Usage

After running:

```bash
npx react-dagis
```

You will be prompted to:

1. Choose your programming language:
   - **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript with better tooling and error prevention. Recommended for larger projects.
   - **JavaScript** - Familiar JavaScript syntax without type annotations. Simpler to start with for smaller projects.

2. Choose a starter template:
   - **React + Redux Toolkit + React Query** - Full-featured setup with global state management (Redux) and efficient data fetching (React Query). Best for complex applications.
   - **React + React Query (no Redux)** - Lightweight setup focused on efficient data fetching. Best for simpler apps that don't need complex global state.
   - **React + Zustand + React Query** - Modern alternative with simpler state management (Zustand) and efficient data fetching. Great balance of simplicity and power.
   - **React + Redux Toolkit + Redux Saga** - Advanced setup for complex async workflows using Redux Saga. Ideal for apps with complex state and side effects.

3. Enter your new project name.

Then, `react-dagis` will:
- Copy the selected template.
- Install all required dependencies.
- Show you how to start your project!

Example output:
```
Choose your Programming Language
❯ TypeScript
  JavaScript

Choose your starter template
❯ React + Redux Toolkit + React Query
  React + React Query (no Redux)
  React + Zustand + React Query
  React + Redux Toolkit + Redux Saga
